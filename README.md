# Everforest Themes for the Zed Editor

Everforest is a Green based scheme created to protect our developer's eyes. It's soft and warn to prevent from eye fatigue.

Thanks to [Sainnhe](https://github.com/sainnhe) who designed this theme.

You can retrieve the original color scheme here: https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest

If you mind help me improve and provide the more accurate version of Everforest to Zed, this is how you can do it.

All colors palettes are defined inside the colors directory where one file is one palette corresponding to the original Everforest palettes.

To build the theme you need to run :

```sh
node main.js
```

And the theme should be available inside `/theme/everforest.json`.

The code inside `main.js` can clearly be improved but it work for what I wanted, so if you want to improve it feel free to do it, else just add the right variables at the right place and build it.
